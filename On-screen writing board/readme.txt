Steps to run this project:  
1. Create a seprate Jupyter notebook  
2. Import all the libraries as done in both the codes (calibrate.py and board.py) in first cell of notebook.  
3. In next cell copy the code of calibrate.py and run this cell.
4. Depending on the color values of your marker adjust the H,S and V values so that you can now see only the tip of your marker in the black and white window.  
5. Now, after calibrating these values close the window by pressing "Esc" button of your keyboard.  
6. This must save a .npy file in the same directory in which you are running your Notebook.  
7. Copy the code of board.py in new cell and run that cell, your on screen board will start and you can use the same pen in same enviroment in which you first calibrated this code.
8. I've added the "Switch" button on the top let corner of your on screen board. So that you can either use a marker for writing comething on screen or you can also erase the written material from the screen.
9. To access the "Switch" button you just need to tap on the top left side of the screen.
